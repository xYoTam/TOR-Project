How to Run:

Start the main server using:

Launch as many relay nodes as you want by running:
python server.py
and enter the main Tor server IP

Start the client GUI with:
python client.py
and enter the main Tor server IP
and enjoy the secure networking!

ðŸ’¡ You can test the communication using destination_server.py, which returns the current time when you send the message "TIME".

2. client.py: a simple GUI that connects to the main server. It sends a message along with the destination's IP and port.
The main server handles all routing and encryption, so the client stays lightweight.

3. destination_server.py: A server to check the project. It will return the current time after sending
